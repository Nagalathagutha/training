		<b>MOSCOW:</b> The ruble hit its highest level in 17 months against the dollar
		Monday as oil prices surged following a landmark deal by Russia and other non-OPEC
		producers to join the cartel in capping output.<br>
		In morning trading, the dollar traded at 61.05 rubles, a level not seen since October 2015,
		 and the euro at 64.54 rubles, also a 17-month high.<br><br>
			Russia and 10 other states on Saturday said they will reduce their production by more than
		half a million barrels per day (bpd), the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced.
		The move marks the first time non-OPEC members have reached an agreement since 2001,
