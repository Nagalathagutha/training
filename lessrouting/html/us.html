		<b>US:</b> After US President-elect Donald Trump+ questioned the
		'One China' policy, Beijing used its state media to warn him that if he <br>
		throws his weight behind Taiwan or uses the issue to bargain on trade,
		"Beijing could offer support, even military assistance to US foes."<br><br>
		"If Trump gave up the One China policy, publicly supported Taiwan independence
		and wantonly sold weapons to Taiwan, China would have no grounds to partner
		with Washington on international affairs and contain forces hostile to
		the  US," said an editorial today in the Global Times, a newspaper associated
		with the Communist party of China, and one that reportedly speaks for
		Beijing on foreign policy issues.
