			Unlike an earthquake, which one is rarely warned about, a cyclonic landfall is something that the Met department warns about hours in advance,
		so residents in affected areas can use this time to prepare.
			Here's a list of dos and don'ts to keep in mind while preparing to negotiate this weather phenomenon.<br>
		It is obviously always better to stay indoors+ as far as possible during such a weather phenomenon. Do not go out,
		do not - especially - allow children, the disabled and the aged outdoors.<br>
			If you live near the water it is better to go away temporarily and stay with family or friends who live up-water.
