		<b>HYDERABAD:</b> An alert software engineer managed to outfox a cyber crook posing 
		as a bank employee who tried to siphon off Rs 19,400 from his account on Sunday.
		 City-based Amazon employee Jashnil Bodele received a call from a fraudster posing as 
		 an SBI employee around 1.30pm on Sunday. "My SBI debit card had expired some time ago
		 and the telecaller, posing as an SBI employee, asked me whether I want to get a fresh card.
		 I said yes. He then asked me to provide an alternate debit card particular
		 as a guarantor card," Jashnil told TOI.
