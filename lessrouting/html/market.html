		<b> NEW DELHI:</b>The benchmark equity indices failed to cheer
		investor sentiment, but there was plenty of stock-specific action on BSE, which saw some
		160 stocks double investor wealth in last one year.<br> For some of them, the rally may not be
		over, yet! Stocks that earned the multibagger tags during the year are mostly
		from the smallcap and midcap segments. They included names like Moschip Semiconductor 
		Technology, DCM Financial Services, Netlink SolutionsBSE 4.86 %.
