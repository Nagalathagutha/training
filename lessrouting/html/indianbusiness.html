		<b>LONDON:</b> Tata Sons interim chairman Ratan Tata was on Sunday hailed as the saviour 
		of the UK steel industry after the Tata Group announced a 10-year commitment
		 of one billion pounds investement to save thousands of jobs for its embattled
		 steelworks in the country last week.<br><br>
		 In a special feature titled 'Man of Steel', the Sunday Times attributes 
		 the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry
		 and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman.
